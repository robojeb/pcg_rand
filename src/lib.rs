//! An implementation of the PCG random family of random number generators.
//! Details about the PCG generators can be found at [pcg-random.org](http://pcg-random.org)
//!
//! Currently this library provides several PCG generators:
//!
//! * `Pcg32` : 64bit LCG with an xorshift and right rotation applied to the output. To improve
//!   security only 32bits of the state are reported as output.
//! * `Pcg32Onseq` : Same as `Pcg32` but with a fixed sequence. Useful if you don't care about having
//!   multiple streams of random numbers from the same seed.
//! * `Pcg32Unique` : Same as `Pcg32` but the sequence is set by the memory location of the RNG
//!   This means that multiple `Pcg32_unique` with the same seed will produce different sequences
//!   of numbers. *NOTE*: This means that you may not get consistant results across runs of your
//!   program. If the memory location of your PCG moves for any reason such as the state of the
//!   allocator being different you will get a different stream of numbers.
//!
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This crate is [on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/pcg_rand) and can be used by
//! adding the `pcg_rand` crate to your projects Cargo.toml
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! pcg_rand = "0.7.0"
//! ```
//! #Typename Nomenclature
//! This library attempts to simplify using the PCG generators by defining easy
//! types for use. The following attempts to help you decode these typenames
//!
//! Consider the example `OneseqXshRr6432`. This consists of 4 major parts.
//!
//! 1. First is the sequence type
//! 1. Second is the permutation function
//! 1. Third is the state size in bits
//! 1. Fourth is the output size in bits
//!
//! ## Sequence types
//!
//! This library provides the following sequence types
//!
//! * `Setseq`: This is a settable stream. The random number stream can be set manually.
//! * `Unique`: This is a unique stream. Each instance of this type will be given a unique stream
//!   that cannot be modified.
//! * `Oneseq`: This is one fixed random sequence. It is hardcoded into the library and should be
//!   good enough to give good "randomness".
//! * `Mcg`: This has no random sequence it degenerates the internal LCG into a MCG. This is for
//!   speed.
//!
//! ## Permutation functions
//!
//! There are many possible permuation functions that this library can implement. Many of them are
//! composed of several indiviual components. The components that are used are:
//!
//! * `Xsh`: Refers to a High Xorshift function.
//! * `Rr`: Refers to a random rotation. Randomly rotates based on entropy from the state.
//! * `Rs`: Refers to a random shift. Randomly shifts based on entropy from the state.
//!
//! #How to Use
//! The simple generators work like the other Rng's from the `rand` crate.
//! You can create a PCG as follows
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate pcg_rand;
//! extern crate rand;
//!
//! use rand::Rng;
//! use pcg_rand::Pcg32;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let mut pcg = Pcg32::new_unseeded();
//! 
//!     let x : u32 = pcg.gen();
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! The extended generators can be built in two ways, either by creating one 
//! directly, or by building them from a generator at its current state.
//!
//! ```
//! use pcg_rand::extension::{Pcg32Ext, ExtPcg, Ext256};
//! use pcg_rand::Pcg32Unique;
//! //Create an extended generator explicitly
//! let ext1 = Pcg32Ext::<Ext256>::new_unseeded();
//! 
//! //Create from another PCG
//! let ext2 : ExtPcg<_,_,_,_,_,Ext256> = ExtPcg::from_pcg(Pcg32Unique::new_unseeded());
//! ```
